This library implements alphabetical sorting according to given alphabet scheme. Currently, only Czech alphabet is included, but it is super-easy to create a new one.

h1. Setup

Install the gem:

bc. gem install sort-by-alphabet

Or require it into Rails:

bc. gem require "sort-by-alphabet"

h1. Requirements

Support of @mb_chars@, i.e. _ActiveSupport_ in practice.

h1. Usage

Classical sort puts accented chars after normal:

bc. %w{nazdar ahoj čau}.sort # => %w{ahoj nazdar čau}

@sort_by_alphabet@ does a better job:

bc. %w{nazdar ahoj čau}.sort_by_alphabet(CzechAlphabet) # => %w{ahoj čau nazdar}

@sort_by_alphabet@ can take a block which acts similarly as that in @sort_by@:

bc. Something.all.sort_by_alphabet(CzechAlphabet) {|o| o.title}

You can also make a class alphabetically comparable:

bc. class Something
  comparable_by_alphabet(CzechAlphabet)
end

or use a block, e.g. for case insensitivity:

bc. class SomethingElse
  comparable_by_alphabet(CzechAlphabet) {|obj| obj.mb_chars.downcase}
end
